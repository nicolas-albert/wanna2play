# Steam import without Web API key (fallback)
# If you cannot (or don't want to) create a Web API key, you can import from the Steam Community games list.
# This used to work for public profiles, but Steam may now require login for /games (so consider it unreliable).
# If you have Steam installed on the host, prefer STEAM_LOCAL_ROOT instead (installed games only).
# You can set either:
# - a full profile URL (https://steamcommunity.com/id/<vanity> or /profiles/<steamid64>)
# - a SteamID64
# - a vanity ID

# Steam import from a local Steam installation (installed games only)
